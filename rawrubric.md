I’ve prepared a detailed methodology that turns the Echo.Kern manifest and status report into an actionable scoring system for evaluating repositories against kernel and OS requirements.  The rubric defines ten core kernel primitives (boot, scheduling, process/thread management, memory, interrupt handling, system call interface, basic I/O, synchronisation, timers/clock, and protection) and eight OS platform services (virtual memory, driver framework, filesystem, networking, IPC, security, power management, profiling).  Each primitive/service has an assigned weight based on criticality, evidence cues to look for in code, and a target number of functions or SLOC from the manifest.

The scoring procedure multiplies a presence indicator (0/0.5/1) by a completeness ratio (functions found ÷ target) and the category’s weight, then normalises the totals to yield separate kernel and OS scores on a 0‑100 scale.  A classification table interprets these scores, distinguishing between kernel‑grade repositories, prototypes, OS‑platforms and application/other code.  The rubric also suggests extensions (sub‑weights, runtime tests, domain‑specific tweaks) and demonstrates a worked example.

You can read the full rubric here: [rubric-kern-os-plat.docx](rubric-kern-os-plat.docx).
